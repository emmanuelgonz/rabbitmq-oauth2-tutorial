# RabbitMQ OAuth2 Tutorial

The instructions on how to configure and test RabbitMQ with various OAuth 2.0 providers have been moved to [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/oauth2-examples). This repository only maintains the configuration files referenced from the RabbitMQ documentation and the
scripts used in some of the examples.
